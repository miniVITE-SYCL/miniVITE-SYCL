### Testing Suite

There are no available tests for the miniVITE application

#### Approach

We'll need to come up with a set of tests that can be performed on different miniVITE ports. We'll also need to get more experience with C++ testing frameworks

This will likely be a seperate Git repo (maybe submodule?) that we'll retrieve into here so that it can be shared amongst implementations
